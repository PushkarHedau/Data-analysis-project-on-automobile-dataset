Title: Exploratory Data Analysis of Automobile Dataset to Identify Fuel-Efficient Cars

Summary:
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the automobile dataset with the objective of identifying fuel-efficient cars. Utilized SQL for initial analysis and gained key insights into the dataset. Performed EDA on features such as mileage, weight, horsepower, acceleration, origin country, displacement, and number of cylinders. Established correlations among these factors and employed Tableau to create an interactive dashboard for data visualization.

Key Points:

Analyzed the automobile dataset using SQL to extract initial insights and understand the data structure.
Focused on identifying fuel-efficient cars through EDA.
Investigated correlations among features such as mileage, weight, horsepower, acceleration, origin country, displacement, and number of cylinders.
Utilized Tableau to create a visually appealing and interactive dashboard for data visualization.
Presented key findings and insights through the dashboard.
Description:
In my project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the automobile dataset with the objective of identifying fuel-efficient cars. To gain initial insights and understand the data structure, I performed analysis using SQL.

Next, I focused on the key factors that contribute to fuel efficiency in cars. I explored features such as mileage, weight, horsepower, acceleration, origin country, displacement, and the number of cylinders. By analyzing these factors, I aimed to establish correlations and identify patterns associated with fuel efficiency.

To visualize and present the findings effectively, I leveraged Tableau. With Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard that allowed for dynamic exploration of the dataset. The dashboard provided visual representations of the relationships between mileage and other factors, enabling better understanding of the data and identification of fuel-efficient cars.
